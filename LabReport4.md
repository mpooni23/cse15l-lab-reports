# Week 7 - Vim 

For this lab report we reproduce steps 4-9 shown below, take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys were pressed to get to that step. 

Step 4. Log into ieng6

Step 5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)

step 6.  Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

step 7.  Edit the code file to fix the failing test

step 8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

step 9.Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)

# **4. Log into ieng6**

**Keys Pressed**: ```ssh cs15lfa23nz@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` was the command typed in at the command prompt followed by pressing the ```<enter>``` key to log in to the ieng6 account/computer. 

# **5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)**

**Keys Pressed**: To complete this step, what I did was type in (on my keyboard)  ```git clone git@github.com:mpooni23/lab7.git```. Then I pressed the ```<enter>``` key to run the command, and the resulting screenshot is what was demonstrated (failure in one of the tests).

# **6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail**
